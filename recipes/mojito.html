    <p>A mojito is a classic highball drink that originated in Cuba. Not surprisingly, this cocktail uses ingredients indigenous to Cuba, including rum, lime, mint, and sugar. The mixture is topped off with a little club soda to create a thirst-quenching libation. It requires a bit more labor than many mixed drinks, as it involves first muddling fresh mint, lime, and sugar together to release the flavors. But it's well worth it for a refreshing, fizzy, and mildly sweet rum cocktail that remains one of the most popular to this day.</p>
    <strong>Ingredients</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>10 fresh mint leaves</li>
        <li> ½ medium lime, cut into 3 wedges, divided</li>

        <li>1 cup ice cubes, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 ½ fluid ounces white rum</li>
        <li>½ cup club soda, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Directions</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>Place mint leaves and 1 lime wedge into a sturdy glass. Use a muddler and crush to release mint oils and lime juice.</li>
        <li>Add remaining lime wedges and 2 tablespoons sugar, and muddle again to release the lime juice. Do not strain the mixture.</li>
        <li>Fill the glass almost to the top with ice.</li>
        <li>Pour in rum and fill the glass with club soda.</li>
        <li>Stir, taste, and add more sugar if desired.</li>
    </ol>
